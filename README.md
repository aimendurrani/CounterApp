# CounterApp

This project is a simple Counter App built in Angular to practice **core Angular concepts**.
It demonstrates **interpolation** (`{{count}}`) for displaying dynamic data, **event binding** (`(click)`) for handling button clicks, and **property binding** (`[disabled]`) for conditional UI states.
All logic is managed inside a **component class** defined with the `@Component` decorator, using a `count` property for state and `handleCounter()` for updates.
Through building this, I reinforced my understanding of **data binding, component structure, and conditional rendering** in Angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
